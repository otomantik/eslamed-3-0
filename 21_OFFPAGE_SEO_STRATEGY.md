## 🏛️ 1. LOCAL CITATION MATRIX (Yerel Kayıtlar)

To dominate the "near me" searches in Istanbul, we must be listed in every high-authority local directory.

* **Google Business Profile (GBP):** The holy grail. We must optimize for **"Oksijen Tüpü Dolumu [İlçe]"** keywords.
* **Local Directories:** Registration in "Sarı Sayfalar," "Bulurum.com," and "Yandex Rehber."
* **NAP Consistency:** (Name, Address, Phone) must be **identical** across the web to build 100% trust with Google's algorithm.

## 🧪 2. THE "HOSPITAL & CLINIC" BACKLINK NET (Deneysel)

We won't buy cheap, spammy links. We target high-relevance medical authority.

* **Strategy:** Guest posting or listing on local health blogs, private clinic directories, and patient support forums.
* **Anchor Text Strategy:** * 40% Brand ("Eslamed", "Eslamed Medikal")
    * 30% Specific Services ("Oksijen Tüpü Dolumu", "Konsantratör Kiralama")
    * 30% Geographic ("İstanbul Oksijen Servisi", "Ümraniye Oksijen Dolumu")

---

## 🧠 3. EXPERIMENTAL: "THE DIGITAL PR LOOP"

For high-performing keywords from your report like *"oksijen konsantratörü çok ses çıkarıyor"*, we create **"How-to Solve"** infographics and distribute them to local news sites or health portals.

* **The Hook:** "5 Steps to fix a noisy oxygen machine."
* **The Link:** "If it still beeps, contact [Eslamed's Technical Service Page]."

---

## 📡 4. SOCIAL SIGNALS & COMMUNITY TRUST

While social media links are "no-follow," the traffic and brand mentions they generate are huge ranking factors.

* **Facebook Groups:** Activity in "KOAH Hasta Yakınları" or "Evde Bakım" groups.
* **YouTube Authority:** Short videos (Shorts) of Salih delivering a machine in record time.
* **Result:** Increased "Branded Search" (People searching for "Eslamed" directly), which is the strongest SEO signal.

## 🛡️ 5. REPUTATION MANAGEMENT (The Review Engine)

Salih's PWA will have a "Send Review Request" button after every successful **"Refill"** or **"Sale."**

1.  **Trigger:** Salih clicks "Job Completed."
2.  **Action:** A WhatsApp message is sent: *"We hope you are breathing easier. Would you mind leaving a 5-star review for our [District] team?"*
3.  **Impact:** More Google Reviews = Higher ranking in **Local Map Pack.**

---

## 🛠️ 6. COMPETITOR GAP ANALYSIS (Anti-Backlink)

We use tools (Ahrefs/Semrush) to see where competitors (like "X Medikal") are getting their links.
* **Action:** If they are listed on a "Medical Equipment List," we ensure Eslamed is there too, but with a better description and faster response time.

## 📊 7. TRACKING THE OFF-PAGE IMPACT

We monitor the "Referral Traffic" in **ClickHouse**:
* `source`: 'external_blog_post'
* `medium`: 'referral'
* **Success Metric:** Does traffic from a health forum convert better than PMax? (If yes, we double down on that forum).
