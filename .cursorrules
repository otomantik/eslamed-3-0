## Logic Gate Protocol (The Mind)

When processing any request, follow the "Check-Verify-Anchor" loop to prevent hallucinations:

### 1. Strict Retrieval (RAG)
Before generating content about business credentials:
- ✅ **MUST** reference `/assets/documents/` for official documents (UTS, License, Authority) (NOT `/public/assets/documents/` - Next.js public folder is root-mapped)
- ✅ **MUST** verify against Reality Anchors above
- ✅ **MUST** check ExpertVerificationPanel data source

### 2. Logic Filter
```
IF (Data == Business_Anchor) 
  → Proceed with high confidence
ELSE IF (Data != Business_Anchor)
  → Terminate generation and flag as "Inconsistency Detected"
  → Do NOT proceed until user confirms or corrects
```

### 3. Title Guard
- ❌ **NEVER** refer to Salih Cevheroğlu as "Biomedical Engineer" unless a specific diploma is added to the anchors
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use "Responsible Manager (Mesul Müdür)" as primary title
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use "Responsible Manager (Mesul Müdür) & Medical Device Specialist" in ExpertVerificationPanel

## Ethical Framework

### Medical E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

1. **Expert Verification Panel Requirement**
   - Every guide or product page **MUST** display the Expert Verification Panel
   - Last Reviewed Date **MUST** be set to `2026-01-03`
   - Expert profile **MUST** reference `ESLAMED_EXPERTS.salih` from `/lib/integrity/eslamed-experts.ts`

2. **Content Authority**
   - All medical/technical content **MUST** include expert verification
   - **MUST** display last review date to avoid "Update Required" warnings
   - **MUST** reference official business credentials

### EHDS Compliance

1. **Data Portability**
   - All user-facing data interfaces **MUST** support machine-readable JSON exports
   - Patient data export endpoints **MUST** be EHDS-compliant
   - KVKK/GDPR consent forms **MUST** be clearly visible

2. **Data Format Standards**
   - Export formats: JSON, PDF
   - **MUST** include timestamps, device IDs, and service history
   - **MUST** follow EHDS interoperability standards

### Visual Integrity & UX

1. **Mobile Responsive Rules**
   - **NEVER** allow overlapping elements on mobile devices
   - Elements **MUST** stack vertically on mobile: Preview → Title → Description → Action
   - All buttons **MUST** have minimum 44px height for touch targets
   - Text **MUST** use `break-words` or `hyphens-auto` for long titles

2. **Layout Hierarchy**
   - Mobile: Use `flex-col` layout
   - Desktop: Can use `flex-row` with proper spacing
   - **MUST** ensure proper padding: `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8` at minimum

3. **Typography Responsiveness**
   - **MUST** use responsive font sizes: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl`
   - Body text: `text-xs sm:text-sm` minimum
   - **MUST** prevent text overflow with proper break classes

---

## Code Generation Rules

### File Path Standards
- PDF documents: `/assets/documents/` (NOT `/documents/`)
- Preview images: `/assets/documents/previews/`
- Expert profiles: `/lib/integrity/eslamed-experts.ts`

### Component Requirements
- ExpertVerificationPanel: **MUST** use `ESLAMED_EXPERTS.salih` from lib file
- Schema.org JSON-LD: **MUST** use official business name `ESLAMED MEDİKAL - SALİH CEVHEROĞLU`
- All addresses: **MUST** use exact format `Alemdağ Mah. Atabey Cad. No:19/E1A`

### TypeScript Safety
- **MUST** use type assertions for FilterKey unions to prevent compilation errors
- **MUST** ensure all props match interface definitions
- **MUST** validate data against Reality Anchors before using in components

## Fatal Error Response

If you detect an inconsistency with Reality Anchors:

1. **STOP** code generation immediately
2. **FLAG** the inconsistency clearly
3. **ASK** user to confirm or correct the data
